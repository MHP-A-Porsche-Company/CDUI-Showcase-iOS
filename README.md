#Component Driven UI Showcase for iOS

##Installation

You need [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to install needed dependencies. Run
```carthage update --platform iOS --no-use-binaries
```
to not download precompiled binaries, but compile them on your machine with the current swift version.

Otherwise, Xcode might complain that a framework was compiled with a wrong version of Swift.
