# Component Driven UI Showcase for iOS

## About this project

As always, documentation is lacking. But this will change soonâ„¢.

## Getting up and running

You need Xcode 9 to run the project.
Dependencies are checked in, so just clone and compile.

## Updating Dependencies

You need [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you want to install or update dependencies.

Run `carthage update --platform iOS --no-use-binaries` to not download precompiled binaries, but compile them on your machine with the current swift version.

Otherwise, Xcode might complain that a framework was compiled with a wrong version of Swift.
